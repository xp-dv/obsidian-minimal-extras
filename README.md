# Obsidian Minimal Extras

This CSS snippet for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) brings additional customization to the [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) by [@kepano](https://github.com/kepano) in order to improve content perception and add personal flair. This snippet is currently a WIP, but new features will continue to be added as I build and customize my Obsidian vault.

> [!important]
> This snippet requires the [Obsidian Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) by [@mgmeyers](https://github.com/mgmeyers). This community plugin gives users a dynamic graphical user interface for customizing every feature in this snippet, and is also necessary for basic functionality. Community plugins are downloaded, installed, and enabled within the Obsidian application through the *Settings* â†’ *Community plugins* tab.

> [!tip]
> Some features of this snippet, such as [Horizontal Rules](#horizontal-rules), are theme agnostic. Custom standalone versions of each section can be made by copying the CSS and Obsidian Style Settings corresponding to your desired section to another .css file in the snippets folder of your Obsidian vault. This snippet should then be disabled and your new standalone snippet(s) enabled.

### Features:

- [Horizontal Rules](#horizontal-rules)
